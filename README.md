## Colored2

This is a fork of Chris (defunkt) Wanstrath's colored gem, which appears to be no longer supported.

This fork comes with a slightly spruced up syntax and rspecs.

## Usage

In addition to the simple syntax of the original gem, which affected only the string to the left of the method call, 
the "bang" syntax affects a string to the right. If the block or a method argument is provided,
the contents is wrapped in the color, and the color is then reset back. If no block
or argument is provided, the color is left open-ended, and must be explicitly reset â€“ when using the 'bang' notation.

## Usage in Other Classes

You can decorate and color not just strings. 

To color numbers, require the following file, which automatically decorates `Fixnum` and `Float`.  You can also add color methods 
to the `Object`. Finally, you can add the methods to any custom class by including the `Colored2` Module.

Below is an `IRB` session that shows a slightly more advanced usage.
